    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Our school canteen is very well equipped.
       One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. 
       They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat,
        and ovens to keep the food warm.  A canteen is a store that sells food and drink at an institution like a camp,
         college, or military base. A canteen can also be a small container used to carry water to drink. 
         If you're at summer camp, you can buy snacks at the canteen. This kind of canteen is a little shop.</p>

  <h4>Implemented online Attendece Management System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-5">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
   An attendance management system lets teachers assess their students' location and clock in/out.
  Overall, it provides complete data on the time the students are present in the school and take time-off. 
  Using it means saving time and effort into tracking, monitoring, and compiling daily student attendance data.
  You can check who is on holidays or a lunch break. The software is a better option compared to spreadsheets 
  or complex and pricey solutions designed for large corporations. Business owners with attendance system can keep close
   monitoring of their workforce productivity and improve team management in the cloud! It's designed to 
   automate and streamline the process of keeping track of students' attendance. It helps to substitute digital platforms
   for paper attendance records. It also makes it simpler for teachers to track attendance. These systems provide 
  detailed reporting and analytics for data-driven decision-making.

   2. Economics
  This document provides a project report for an Online Attendance Management System.
   It includes sections on the synopsis, objectives, theoretical background, feasibility study, system analysis and design,
  and implementation. The proposed system aims to computerize the traditional paper-based attendance tracking system
  to make it more efficient and reduce manual work. It will allow generating reports in real-time and notifying students 
  about attendance shortages. The feasibility study finds the project economically, technically, behaviorally and operationally feasible.
  The system analysis covers requirements gathering and the existing and proposed system workflows. Overall, this document outlines 
  the development of an automated attendance management system
  <br>
   3.Productivity / Efficiency
  If you are thinking about why an online attendance management system is necessary for a working environment,
  then you ought to understand that every employee gets a task schedule. Implementing an appropriate online attendance management system 
  software for employees is crucial, regardless of the size of the business. The overall task timeline and completion of projects can be
  delayed by employees who take frequent leaves or who violate the attendance policy.When there is no employee attendance system in place,
  businesses deal with problems including inconsistent paychecks and accountability issues among other things. Businesses can save time,
  reduce human labor, and get rid of drawn-out procedures by switching from paper-based timesheets to appropriate online attendance
  management system software.
